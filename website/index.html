<h2>Basketball</h2>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<div class="content">
 <p style="font-size: 20px">
 Basketball is a team sport in which two teams, most commonly of five players each, opposing one another on a rectangular court, compete with the primary objective of shooting a basketball through the defender's hoop, while preventing the opposing team from shooting through their own hoop. Points are scored as 1pt, 2pt and 3pts.

<h3>Golf</h3>

<div class="content">
 <p style="font-size: 20px">
 Golf is a club-and-ball sport in which players use various clubs to hit a ball into a series of holes on a course in as few strokes as possible. Golf, unlike most ball games, cannot and does not use a standardized playing area, and coping with the varied terrains encountered on different courses is a key and important part of the game.

<h4>Soccer</h4>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<div class="content">
 <p style="font-size: 20px">
 Soccer is a team sport played between two teams of 11 players each, who primarily use their feet to propel a ball around a rectangular field called a pitch. The objective of the game is to score more goals than the opposing team by moving the ball beyond the goal line into a rectangular-framed goal defended by the opposing team.

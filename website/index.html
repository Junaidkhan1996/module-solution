 <p>
 Basketball is a team sport in which two teams, most
commonly of five players each, opposing one another on a rectangular court,
compete with the primary objective of shooting a basketball through the
defender's hoop, while preventing the opposing team from shooting through their
own hoop. Points are scored as 1pt, 2pt and 3pts.

 <p>
 Golf is a club-and-ball sport in which players use
various clubs to hit a ball into a series of holes on a course in as few strokes
as possible. Golf, unlike most ball games, cannot and does not use a
standardized playing area, and coping with the varied terrains encountered on
different courses is a key and important part of the game.

 <h2>Soccer</h2>

 </div>
 <div class="paragraph">
 <p>
 Soccer is a team sport played between two teams
of 11 players each, who primarily use their feet to propel a ball around a
rectangular field called a pitch. The objective of the game is to score more
goals than the opposing team by moving the ball beyond the goal line into a
rectangular-framed goal defended by the opposing team. Each game is played for
90 minutes.
